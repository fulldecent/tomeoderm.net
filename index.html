        <h3>Michael A. Tomeo MD</h3>
        <p>
          He brings with him over three decades of clinical experience as a board-certified Dermatologist.
          Formerly, Dr. Tomeo was a Clinical Instructor in Dermatology at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia
          and served as Chief of Dermatology at Holy Redeemer Hospital in Meadowbrook, PA, where he practiced for many
          years. He was awarded Greater Philadelphia “Top Doctor” 2018&ndash;2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, he has lectured extensively on topics related to Dermatology to his medical colleagues and
          also to the community at large. He has been a consultant to dermatologic-related pharmaceutical companies and
          has participated in clinical pharmaceutical studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born and raised in the Philadelphia area, Dr. Tomeo graduated from Abington High School, where he was a member
          of the National Honor Society. He pursued his undergraduate degree at Temple University, where he graduated
          Summa Cum Laude in 1979 and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Dr. Tomeo obtained his medical
          degree from Temple University School of Medicine in 1983. He furthered his medical education at Abington
          Memorial Hospital as an Intern in Internal Medicine. He then completed a three-year residency at the Skin and
          Cancer Hospital of Temple University Hospital. Dr Tomeo achieved board certification through the American
          Board of Dermatology and became a Fellow of the Academy of Dermatology in 1987.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing his medical training, Dr. Tomeo joined The Palm Beach Medical Group of West Palm Beach,
          Florida, as an associate physician in the Department of Dermatology for one year. He then returned to the
          Philadelphia area, started his own private practice in Dermatology, and affiliated with the medical staffs of
          Holy Redeemer Hospital and Hahnemann University Hospital.
